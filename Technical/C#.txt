The .Net Framework :

The .Net framework is a revolutionary platform that helps you to write the following types of applications:

	Windows applications
	Web applications
	Web services

The .Net framework applications are multi-platform applications. The framework has been designed in such a way that it can be used from any of the following languages: C#, C++, Visual Basic, Jscript, COBOL, etc. All these languages can access the framework as well as communicate with each other.

The .Net framework consists of an enormous library of codes used by the client languages such as C#. Following are some of the components of the .Net framework:

	Common Language Runtime (CLR)
	The .Net Framework Class Library
	Common Language Specification
	Common Type System
	Metadata and Assemblies
	Windows Forms
	ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX
	ADO.Net
	Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)
	Windows Presentation Foundation
	Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
	LINQ

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C# :

Microsoft provides the following development tools for C# programming

	Visual Studio 2010 (VS)
	Visual C# 2010 Express (VCE)
	Visual Web Developer

The last two are freely available from Microsoft official website. Using these tools, you can write all kinds of C# programs from simple command-line applications to more complex applications. You can also write C# source code files using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compile the code into assemblies using the command-line compiler, which is again a part of the .NET Framework.

Visual C# Express and Visual Web Developer Express edition are trimmed down versions of Visual Studio and has the same appearance. They retain most features of Visual Studio.



Writing C# Programs on Linux or Mac OS :

Although the.NET Framework runs on the Windows operating system, there are some alternative versions that work on other operating systems. Mono is an open-source version of the .NET Framework which includes a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS. Kindly check Go Mono.

The stated purpose of Mono is not only to be able to run Microsoft .NET applications cross-platform, but also to bring better development tools for Linux developers. Mono can be run on many operating systems including Android, BSD, iOS, Linux, OS X, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX.

Creating Hello World Program :

A C# program consists of the following parts:

	Namespace declaration
	A class
	Class methods
	Class attributes
	A Main method
	Statements and Expressions
	Comments

Let us look at a simple code that prints the words "Hello World":

using System;
namespace HelloWorldApplication
{
   class HelloWorld
   {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
         /* my first program in C# */
         Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}

Let us look at the various parts of the given program:

==> The first line of the program using System; - the using keyword is used to include the System namespace in the program. A program generally has multiple using statements.
==> The next line has the namespace declaration. A namespace is a collection of classes. The HelloWorldApplication namespace contains the class HelloWorld.
==> The next line has a class declaration, the class HelloWorld contains the data and method definitions that your program uses. Classes generally contain multiple methods. Methods define the behavior of the class. However, the HelloWorld class has only one method Main.
==> The next line defines the Main method, which is the entry point for all C# programs. The Main method states what the class does when executed.
==> The next line /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is put to add comments in the program.
==> The Main method specifies its behavior with the statement Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

Why should main be static in class
You need an entry point into your program. Static means that you can call the function without having to instantiate an object/instance of a class. Its a bit "chicken and egg"... you can't instantiate an object before you're inside the program.

WriteLine is a method of the Console class defined in the System namespace. This statement causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.

==> The last line Console.ReadKey(); is for the VS.NET Users. This makes the program wait for a key press and it prevents the screen from running and closing quickly when the program is launched from Visual Studio .NET.

It is worth to note the following points:

==> C# is case sensitive.
==> All statements and expression must end with a semicolon (;).
==> The program execution starts at the Main method.
==> Unlike Java, program file name could be different from the class name.

Compiling and Executing the Program

If you are using Visual Studio.Net for compiling and executing C# programs, take the following steps:

==> Start Visual Studio.
==> On the menu bar, choose File -> New -> Project.
==> Choose Visual C# from templates, and then choose Windows.
==> Choose Console Application.
==> Specify a name for your project and click OK button.
==> This creates a new project in Solution Explorer.
==> Write code in the Code Editor.
==> Click the Run button or press F5 key to execute the project. A Command Prompt window appears that contains the line Hello World.
==> You can compile a C# program by using the command-line instead of the Visual Studio IDE:
==> Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
==> Save the file as helloworld.cs
==> Open the command prompt tool and go to the directory where you saved the file.
==> Type csc helloworld.cs and press enter to compile your code.
==> If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt takes you to the next line and generates helloworld.exe executable file.
==> Type helloworld to execute your program.

You can see the output Hello World printed on the screen.

C# Keywords
Keywords are reserved words predefined to the C# compiler. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers. However, if you want to use these keywords as identifiers, you may prefix the keyword with the @ character.

In C#, some identifiers have special meaning in context of code, such as get and set are called contextual keywords.

The following table lists the reserved keywords and contextual keywords in C#:

C# - Data Types : The varibles in C#, are categorized into the following types:

	Value types
	Reference types
	Pointer types

==> Value Type
Value type variables can be assigned a value directly. 
They are derived from the class System.ValueType.
The value types directly contain data. 
Some examples are int, char, and float, which stores numbers, alphabets, and floating point numbers, respectively. 

==> Reference Type
The reference types do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they contain a reference to the variables.
In other words, they refer to a memory location. Using multiple variables, the reference types can refer to a memory location. If the data in the memory location is changed by one of the variables, the other variable automatically reflects this change in value. Example of built-in reference types are: 

	1] object
	2] dynamic
	3] string


1] Object Type :
The Object Type is the ultimate base class for all data types in C# Common Type System (CTS). Object is an alias for System.Object class. The object types can be assigned values of any other types, value types, reference types, predefined or user-defined types. However, before assigning values, it needs type conversion.When a value type is converted to object type, it is called boxing and on the other hand, when an object type is converted to a value type, it is called unboxing.

	object obj;
	obj = 100; // this is boxing


2] Dynamic Type :
You can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable. Type checking for these types of variables takes place at run-time.

Syntax for declaring a dynamic type is :dynamic <variable_name> = value;
For example : dynamic d = 20;

Dynamic types are similar to object types except that type checking for object type variables takes place at compile time, whereas that for the dynamic type variables takes place at run time.


3] String Type :
The String Type allows you to assign any string values to a variable. The string type is an alias for the System.String class. It is derived from object type. The value for a string type can be assigned using string literals in two forms: quoted and @quoted.

For example,

String str = "Tutorials Point";
A @quoted string literal looks as follows:

@"Tutorials Point";
The user-defined reference types are: class, interface, or delegate. We will discuss these types in later chapter.


==> Pointer Type
Pointer type variables store the memory address of another type. Pointers in C# have the same capabilities as the pointers in C or C++.

Syntax for declaring a pointer type is:
type* identifier;

For example,
char* cptr;
int* iptr;

ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ

Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers:

Public
Private
Protected
Internal
Protected internal

internal is for assembly scope (i.e. only accessible from code in the same .exe or .dll)

private is for class scope (i.e. accessible only from code in the same class).

Sealed : Can not be inherited

Passing Parameters to a Method
When method with parameters is called, you need to pass the parameters to the method. There are three ways that parameters can be passed to a method:

Mechanism		Description
Value parameters	This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function 			have no effect on the argument.
Reference parameters	This method copies the reference to the memory location of an argument into the formal parameter. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the 			argument.
Output parameters	This method helps in returning more than one value.

Nullable Types :

C# provides a special data types, the nullable types, to which you can assign normal range of values as well as null values.

For example, you can store any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or null in a Nullable<Int32> variable. Similarly, you can assign true, false, or null in a Nullable<bool> variable. Syntax for declaring a nullable type is as follows:

< data_type> ? <variable_name> = null;

ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ

Declaring Arrays :

To declare an array in C#, you can use the following syntax:
datatype[] arrayName;

You can assign values to individual array elements, by using the index number, like:
double[] balance = new double[10];
balance[0] = 4500.0;

You can assign values to the array at the time of declaration, as shown:
double[] balance = { 2340.0, 4523.69, 3421.0};

You can also create and initialize an array, as shown:
int [] marks = new int[5]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};

You may also omit the size of the array, as shown:
int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};

You can copy an array variable into another target array variable. In such case, both the target and source point to the same memory location:
int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};
int[] score = marks;

When you create an array, C# compiler implicitly initializes each array element to a default value depending on the array type. For example, for an int array all elements are initialized to 0.

Defining a Structure

struct Books
{
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
};  

Features of C# Structures :
You have already used a simple structure named Books. Structures in C# are quite different from that in traditional C or C++. The C# structures have the following features:

	1] Structures can have methods, fields, indexers, properties, operator methods, and events.	
	2] Structures can have defined constructors, but not destructors. However, you cannot define a default constructor for a structure. The default constructor is automatically 	defined and cannot be changed.
	3] Unlike classes, structures cannot inherit other structures or classes.
	4] Structures cannot be used as a base for other structures or classes.
	5] A structure can implement one or more interfaces.
	6] Structure members cannot be specified as abstract, virtual, or protected.
	7] When you create a struct object using the New operator, it gets created and the appropriate constructor is called. Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without 	using the New operator.
	8] If the New operator is not used, the fields remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all the fields are initialized.


Class versus Structure :
Classes and Structures have the following basic differences:

	1] classes are reference types and structs are value types
	2] structures do not support inheritance
	3] structures cannot have default constructor

Multiple Inheritance in C# ==>
C# does not support multiple inheritance. However, you can use interfaces to implement multiple inheritance. The following program demonstrates this:

using System;
namespace InheritanceApplication
{
   class Shape 
   {
      public void setWidth(int w)
      {
         width = w;
      }
      public void setHeight(int h)
      {
         height = h;
      }
      protected int width;
      protected int height;
   }

   // Base class PaintCost
   public interface PaintCost 
   {
      int getCost(int area);

   }
   
   // Derived class
   class Rectangle : Shape, PaintCost
   {
      public int getArea()
      {
         return (width * height);
      }
      public int getCost(int area)
      {
         return area * 70;
      }
   }
   class RectangleTester
   {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
         Rectangle Rect = new Rectangle();
         int area;
         Rect.setWidth(5);
         Rect.setHeight(7);
         area = Rect.getArea();
         
         // Print the area of the object.
         Console.WriteLine("Total area: {0}",  Rect.getArea());
         Console.WriteLine("Total paint cost: ${0}" , Rect.getCost(area));
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}

Output :

Total area: 35
Total paint cost: $2450

Dynamic Polymorphism
C# allows you to create abstract classes that are used to provide partial class implementation of an interface. Implementation is completed when a derived class inherits from it. Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which are implemented by the derived class. The derived classes have more specialized functionality.

Here are the rules about abstract classes:

	-You cannot create an instance of an abstract class
	-You cannot declare an abstract method outside an abstract class
	-When a class is declared sealed, it cannot be inherited, abstract classes cannot be declared sealed.

The following program demonstrates an abstract class:

What is assembly in C# :

Assembly is the smallest unit of deployment of a .net application. It can be a dll or an exe.
There are mainly two types to it:

Private Assembly: The dll or exe which is sole property of one application only. It is generally stored in application root folder

Public/Shared assembly: It is a dll which can be used by multiple applications at a time. A shared assembly is stored in GAC i.e Global Assembly Cache.

GAC is simply C:\Windows\Assembly folder where you can find the public assemblies/dlls of all the softwares installed in your PC.

There is also a third and least known type of an assembly: Satellite Assembly.
A Satellite Assembly contains only static objects like images and other non-executable files required by the application.

Encapsulation is defined 'as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package'. Encapsulation, in object oriented programming methodology, prevents access to implementation details.

Abstraction and encapsulation are related features in object oriented programming. Abstraction allows making relevant information visible and encapsulation enables a programmer to implement the desired level of abstraction.

Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following access specifiers:

	Public
	Private
	Protected
	Internal
	Protected internal

public :The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.

private : The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct.

protected : The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct, or in a derived class.

internal : The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.

protected internal : The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly.

Nullable types can represent all the values of an underlying type, and an additional null value. Nullable types are declared in one of two ways:

	System.Nullable<T> variable
		-or-
	T? variable

T is the underlying type of the nullable type. T can be any value type including struct; it cannot be a reference type.
For an example of when you might use a nullable type, consider how an ordinary Boolean variable can have two values: true and false. There is no value that signifies "undefined". In many programming applications, most notably database interactions, variables can occur in an undefined state. For example, a field in a database may contain the values true or false, but it may also contain no value at all. Similarly, reference types can be set to null to indicate that they are not initialized.

	int? i = 10;
	double? d1 = 3.14;
	bool? flag = null;
	char? letter = 'a';
	int?[] arr = new int?[10];

Each instance of a nullable type has two public read-only properties:
HasValue : HasValue is of type bool. It is set to true when the variable contains a non-null value.

Value : Value is of the same type as the underlying type. If HasValue is true, Value contains a meaningful value. If HasValue is false, accessing Value will throw a InvalidOperationException.


In this example, the HasValue member is used to test whether the variable contains a value before it tries to display it.
int? x = 10;
if (x.HasValue)
{
    System.Console.WriteLine(x.Value);
}
else
{
    System.Console.WriteLine("Undefined");
}


Testing for a value can also be done as in the following example
int? y = 10;
if (y != null)
{
    System.Console.WriteLine(y.Value);
}
else
{
    System.Console.WriteLine("Undefined");
}


A nullable type can be cast to a regular type, either explicitly with a cast, or by using the Value property. For example:
int? n = null;
//int m1 = n;      // Will not compile. 
int m2 = (int)n;   // Compiles, but will create an exception if n is null. 
int m3 = n.Value;  // Compiles, but will create an exception if n is null.

Another important example 
int? a = 10;
int? b = null;
a++;         // Increment by 1, now a is 11.
a = a * 10;  // Multiply by 10, now a is 110.
a = a + b;   // Add b, now a is null.


When you perform comparisons with nullable types, if the value of one of the nullable types is null and the other is not, all comparisons evaluate to false except for != (not equal). It is important not to assume that because a particular comparison returns false, the opposite case returns true. In the following example, 10 is not greater than, less than, nor equal to null. Only num1 != num2 evaluates to true.

int? num1 = 10;
int? num2 = null;
if (num1 >= num2)
{
    Console.WriteLine("num1 is greater than or equal to num2");
}
else
{
    // This clause is selected, but num1 is not less than num2.
    Console.WriteLine("num1 >= num2 returned false (but num1 < num2 also is false)");
}

if (num1 < num2)
{
    Console.WriteLine("num1 is less than num2");
}
else
{
    // The else clause is selected again, but num1 is not greater than 
    // or equal to num2.
    Console.WriteLine("num1 < num2 returned false (but num1 >= num2 also is false)");
}

if (num1 != num2)
{
    // This comparison is true, num1 and num2 are not equal.
    Console.WriteLine("Finally, num1 != num2 returns true!");
}

// Change the value of num1, so that both num1 and num2 are null.
num1 = null;
if (num1 == num2)
{
    // The equality comparison returns true when both operands are null.
    Console.WriteLine("num1 == num2 returns true when the value of each is null");
}

The ?? Operator :

The ?? operator defines a default value that is returned when a nullable type is assigned to a non-nullable type.

int? c = null;
// d = c, unless c is null, in which case d = -1. 
int d = c ?? -1;


This operator can also be used with multiple nullable types. For example:

int? e = null;
int? f = null;

// g = e or f, unless e and f are both null, in which case g = -1. 
int g = e ?? f ?? -1;

Assigning Values to an Array :

You can assign values to individual array elements, by using the index number, like:

	double[] balance = new double[10];
	balance[0] = 4500.0;

You can assign values to the array at the time of declaration, as shown:

	double[] balance = { 2340.0, 4523.69, 3421.0};

You can also create and initialize an array, as shown:

	int [] marks = new int[5]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};

You may also omit the size of the array, as shown:

	int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};

You can copy an array variable into another target array variable. In such case, both the target and source point to the same memory location:

	int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};
	int[] score = marks;

When you create an array, C# compiler implicitly initializes each array element to a default value depending on the array type. For example, for an int array all elements are initialized to 0.



There are following few important concepts related to array which should be clear to a C# programmer:

Concept					Description
Multi-dimensional arrays		C# supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
Jagged arrays				C# supports multidimensional arrays, which are arrays of arrays.
Passing arrays to functions		You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
Param arrays				This is used for passing unknown number of parameters to a function.
The Array Class				Defined in System namespace, it is the base class to all arrays, and provides various properties and methods for working with arrays.

Features of C# Structures

You have already used a simple structure named Books. Structures in C# are quite different from that in traditional C or C++. The C# structures have the following features:

- Structures can have methods, fields, indexers, properties, operator methods, and events.

- Structures can have defined constructors, but not destructors. However, you cannot define a default constructor for a structure. The default constructor is automatically defined and cannot be changed.

- Unlike classes, structures cannot inherit other structures or classes.

- Structures cannot be used as a base for other structures or classes.

- A structure can implement one or more interfaces.

- Structure members cannot be specified as abstract, virtual, or protected.

- When you create a struct object using the New operator, it gets created and the appropriate constructor is called. Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using the New operator.

- If the New operator is not used, the fields remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all the fields are initialized.


Class versus Structure :

Classes and Structures have the following basic differences:

- classes are reference types and structs are value types

- structures do not support inheritance

- structures cannot have default constructor

ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ



31. What is Common Language Specification (CLS)?
==>CLS is a set of basic rules, which must be followed by each .NET language to be a .NET- compliant language. It enables interoperability between two .NET-compliant languages. CLS is a subset of CTS; therefore, the languages supported by CLS can use each other's class libraries similar to their own. Application programming interfaces (APIs), which are designed by following the rules defined in CLS can be used by all .NET-compliant languages.


32. What is the role of the JIT compiler in .NET Framework?
==>The JIT compiler is an important element of CLR, which loads MSIL on target machines for execution. The MSIL is stored in .NET assemblies after the developer has compiled the code written in any .NET-compliant programming language, such as Visual Basic and C#.

JIT compiler translates the MSIL code of an assembly and uses the CPU architecture of the target machine to execute a .NET application. It also stores the resulting native code so that it is accessible for subsequent calls. If a code executing on a target machine calls a non-native method, the JIT compiler converts the MSIL of that method into native code. JIT compiler also enforces type-safety in runtime environment of .NET Framework. It checks for the values that are passed to parameters of any method. 

For example, the JIT compiler detects any event, if a user tries to assign a 32-bit value to a parameter that can only accept 8-bit value.




33.Describe the roles of CLR in .NET Framework.
==>CLR provides an environment to execute .NET applications on target machines. CLR is also a common runtime environment for all .NET code irrespective of their programming language, as the compilers of respective language in .NET Framework convert every source code into a common language known as MSIL or IL (Intermediate Language).

CLR also provides various services to execute processes, such as memory management service and security services. CLR performs various tasks to manage the execution process of .NET applications.

The responsibilities of CLR are listed as follows:

Automatic memory management
Garbage Collection
Code Access Security
Code verification
JIT compilation of .NET code



1.What are the advantages of C# over C, C++ or Java?
==> Like C++ and Java, C# is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It is generally more efficient than Java and has useful features such as operator overloading. C# is based on C++ but has several advantages over this older language: it is type-safe, more comprehensively object-oriented, and the syntax has been simplified in several important ways. Most importantly, C# interoperates exceptionally well with other languages on the .NET platform. For this reason, C# is a better choice for building applications for .NET.


2.How are namespaces used in C#?
==>Classes in the .NET framework can be organized using namespaces. The scope of a class is declared using the namespace keyword. You can then include methods from the namespace in your code by including the line “using [namespace];” at the start of your program.

Namespaces are used to organize classes within the .NET Framework. They dictate the logical structure of the code. They are analogous to Java packages, with the key difference being Java packages define the physical layout of source files (directory structure) while .NET namespaces do not. However, many developers follow this approach and organize their C# source files in directories that correlate with namespaces. The .NET Framework has namespaces defined for its many classes, such as System.Xml--these are utilized via the using statement. Namespaces are assigned to classes via the namespace keyword.


3.What is the GAC?
==>The acronym GAC stands for Global Assembly Cache. The GAC is where assemblies are stored so that many different applications can share these assemblies. Multiple versions of assemblies can be stored in the GAC, with applications specifying which version to use in the config file.

The GAC is the Global Assembly Cache. Shared assemblies reside in the GAC; this allows applications to share assemblies instead of having the assembly distributed with each application. Versioning allows multiple assembly versions to exist in the GAC--applications can specify version numbers in the config file. The gacutil command line tool is used to manage the GAC.


4.How does .NET help to manage DLLs on a system?
==>When you have multiple DLLs on a system, you are in what is known as “DLL Hell”. Managing the DLLs can be particularly difficult if there are multiple versions of the various DLLs. In the .NET framework, assemblies are managed using the information stored in their metadata, and you can store multiple versions of each in the GAC.



5.What is .NET Framework?
==>.NET Framework is a complete environment that allows developers to develop, run, and deploy the following applications:

Console applications
Windows Forms applications
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications
Web applications (ASP.NET applications)
Web services
Windows services
Service-oriented applications using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
Workflow-enabled applications using Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)

.NET Framework also enables a developer to create sharable components to be used in distributed computing architecture. NET Framework supports the object-oriented programming model for multiple languages, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, and Visual C++. .NET Framework supports multiple programming languages in a manner that allows language interoperability. This implies that each language can use the code written in some other language.


6. What are the main components of .NET Framework?
==>.NET Framework provides enormous advantages to software developers in comparison to the advantages provided by other platforms. Microsoft has united various modern as well as existing technologies of software development in .NET Framework. These technologies are used by developers to develop highly efficient applications for modern as well as future business needs. The following are the key components of .NET Framework:

.NET Framework Class Library
Common Language Runtime
Dynamic Language Runtimes (DLR)
Application Domains
Runtime Host
Common Type System
Metadata and Self-Describing Components
Cross-Language Interoperability
.NET Framework Security
Profiling
Side-by-Side Execution


7. What is an IL?
==>Intermediate Language is also known as MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or CIL (Common Intermediate Language). All .NET source code is compiled to IL. IL is then converted to machine code at the point where the software is installed, or at run-time by a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.


8.What is Manifest?
==>Assembly metadata is stored in Manifest. Manifest contains all the metadata needed to do the following things
Version of assembly.
Security identity.
Scope of the assembly.
Resolve references to resources and classes.

The assembly manifest can be stored in a PE file either (an .exe or) .dll with Microsoft 
intermediate language (MSIL code with Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code or in a 
stand-alone PE file, that contains only assembly manifest information.



9.What is Common Type System (CTS)?

==>CTS is the component of CLR through which .NET Framework provides support for multiple languages because it contains a type system that is common across all the languages. Two CTS-compliant languages do not require type conversion when calling the code written in one language from within the code written in another language. CTS provide a base set of data types for all the languages supported by.NET Framework. This means that the size of integer and long variables is same across all .NET-compliant programming languages. However, each language uses aliases for the base data types provided by CTS. For example, CTS uses the data type system. int32 to represent a 4 byte integer value; however, Visual Basic uses the alias integer for the same; whereas, C# uses the alias int. This is done for the sake of clarity and simplicity.



10. Differentiate between managed and unmanaged code?
==>Managed code is the code that is executed directly by the CLR instead of the operating system. The code compiler first compiles the managed code to intermediate language (IL) code, also called as MSIL code. This code doesn't depend on machine configurations and can be executed on different machines.

Unmanaged code is the code that is executed directly by the operating system outsideide the CLR environment. It is directly compiled to native machine code which depends on the machine configuration.
In the managed code, since the execution of the code is governed by CLR, the runtime provides different services, such as garbage collection, type checking, exception handling, and security support. These services help provide uniformity in platform and language-independent behavior of managed code applications. In the unmanaged code, the allocation of memory, type safety, and security is required to be taken care of by the developer. If the unmanaged code is not properly handled, it may result in memory leak. Examples of unmanaged code are ActiveX components and Win32 APIs that execute beyond the scope of native CLR.


11.Mention the execution process for managed code.

A piece of managed code is executed as follows:

Choosing a language compiler
Compiling the code to MSIL
Compiling MSIL to native code
Executing the code.



12.What are tuples?
==>Tuple is a fixed-size collection that can have elements of either same or different data types. Similar to arrays, a user must have to specify the size of a tuple at the time of declaration. Tuples are allowed to hold up from 1 to 8 elements and if there are more than 8 elements, then the 8th element can be defined as another tuple. Tuples can be specified as parameter or return type of a method.



13.What is Difference between NameSpace and Assembly?
==>Following are the differences between namespace and assembly: 
Assembly is physical grouping of logical units, Namespace, logically groups classes.
Namespace can span multiple assembly.


14.Which is the root namespace for fundamental types in .NET Framework?
==>System.Object is the root namespace for fundamental types in .NET Framework.



15.What is lazy initialization?
==>Lazy initialization is a process by which an object is not initialized until it is first called in your code. The .NET 4.0 introduces a new wrapper class, System.Lazy<T>, for executing the lazy initialization in your application. Lazy initialization helps you to reduce the wastage of resources and memory requirements to improve performance. It also supports thread-safety.

16. Shadowing (method hiding)
A method or function of the base class is available to the child (derived) class without the use of the "overriding" keyword. The compiler hides the function or method of the base class. This concept is known as shadowing or method hiding. In the shadowing or method hiding, the child (derived) class has its own version of the function, the same function is also available in the base class.
